The function of the app is to allow a user to create, store, view & print
characters for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, second edition.

This project was started for a project management class taken by my friend. 
This was the project he managed as his final. 

The site is built on Django and Pinax. The layout is a lightly modified Bootstrap. 
JQueryUI is used for the drag & drop stat sorting. A JQuery plugin called 
DataTables is used for the character list.
