Live site: http://dndcg.fwkb.com

The function of the app is to allow a user to create, store, view & print
characters for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, second edition.

This project was started for a project management class taken by my friend. 
This was the project he managed as his final. 

The site is built on Django and Pinax. The layout is a lightly modified Bootstrap. 
JQueryUI is used for the drag & drop stat sorting. A JQuery plugin called 
DataTables is used for the character list. 

On the live site, the webserver software is Nginx (static content and routing) 
and Apache/WSGI. The server is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on a low-budget Rackspce Cloud 
virtual machine.
